**`Digital Learner (Developer/Creator)`**

I am a new developer currently learning some new stuff and building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube channel to more than almost 1000 subscribers.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a 12yo student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself python with a dream to build my own program, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in C#. A desire that landed me making a good and successful application. However, I had another desire, to learn CPP. I eventually learned beginner CPP, and that has been my focus ever since. Now I am working on a new project that should work out just fine, but again, you need to have a backup plan. It's easier to use something ready than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product.
